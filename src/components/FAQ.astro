		question: "What ages can participate in your sessions?",
		answer:
			"Our sessions welcome rangatahi and tamariki from years 5-13 (ages 9-18). We adapt activities and support to suit different age groups and experience levels - from beginners who've never coded to advanced students leading their own projects.",
	},
	{
		question: "What do you mean by 'technology education'?",
		answer:
			"We focus on hands-on exploration of coding, robotics, 3D printing, digital creativity, and problem-solving using technology. Led by trained kaiako with industry volunteer support, learning happens naturally through passion-driven projects rather than formal lessons.",

	{
		question: "Do sessions really cost nothing?",
		answer:

	},
	{
		question: "Do you need prior technology experience?",
		answer:

	},
	{
		question: "Who runs the sessions?",
		answer:
			"Our sessions are led by trained kaiako (professional educators) with support from industry expert volunteers. All staff undergo appropriate safety checks. This combination provides both educational expertise and real-world tech industry experience for rangatahi.",
	},
	{
		question: "Where do sessions happen?",
		answer:
			"We bring technology education directly to communities! Our sessions run in schools, libraries, community centres, and marae across Wellington, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt, and Porirua. Each location and session is tailored to the community and rangatahi who attend.",
	},
	{
		question: "How can my child join a session?",
		answer:
			"Check our sessions page to find locations near you. If we're not already running sessions in your community, your child can join sessions at nearby locations, or encourage your school, library, or community centre to contact us about bringing sessions to your area.",
	},
	{
		question: "How can I volunteer or support your work?",
		answer:
			"We welcome volunteers with technology backgrounds to support sessions, run workshops, or help with resources. You can also support us through donations or partnerships. Contact us to learn about opportunities that match your skills and availability.",
	},
	{
		question: "How long have you been operating?",
		answer:
			"TÅ«hura Tech was founded in 2022 as a registered charitable trust. We've been serving Wellington communities for over 3 years, supported by established corporate sponsors like WellingtonNZ, Bastion Security Group, Hutt City Council, and Spark Foundation.",

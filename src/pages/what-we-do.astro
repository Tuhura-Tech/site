          At the core of what we do is our After School Sessions where we work
          with Rangatahi to inspire them to explore different areas of
          technology. Sessions cover a variety of topics with junior sessions
          (year 5-8) being slightly structured and senior sessions (year 9-13)
          functioning as a place to explore interests with support from our
          staff. This means that rangatahi are always engaged and learning.
        </p><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
          Junior Sessions (Year 5-8) follow a rough structure where they will
          focus on a topic such as Introduction to Programming with Scratch for
          a Term before moving to another topic. These sessions while focused
          ona topic are guided by their individual interests with a custom path
          through created specifically for them.
        </p><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
          Our Senior sessions (Year 9-13) are more relaxed and casual with
          everyone working on different projects and interests and a small
          section doing a set subject. This is a space to explore and experiment
          with the support of our staff or come along and focus on a topic that
          changes every term.
